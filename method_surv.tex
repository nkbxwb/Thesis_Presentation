\begin{frame}{Kaplan-Meier in the MI Setting}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Clearly define the population, groups, and events of interest
  \item Ensure that we have non-informative censoring
\item Algorithm: Pool the complimentary log-log of the Kaplan-Meier curve, get estimates,
back transform \cite{Marshall2009}
 \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%I want to make this better
\begin{frame}{Median Survival Time}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Want a measure of central tendency
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Survival distributions often skewed, so mean is poor choice
  \end{itemize}
  \item Median: smallest time such that $\hat{S}(t)\leq .5$
\item Algorithm: Take MI Kaplan-Meier curve, observe first time it goes below 50\%
\item Confidence interval at median: the median of the upper and lower confidence bands
 \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Log Rank Test}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Under no tied times, the score test on
  Cox Regression on a treatment is equivalent to the
log rank test
\begin{itemize}
 \item And very similar under tied times
\end{itemize}
\item Idea: Derive log rank test from Cox model
\begin{itemize}
 \item Pooling LRT and Score test is unstable \cite{Marshall2009}
 \item Wald test is asymptotically equivalent
\end{itemize}
 \item Final Solution: Run the Wald test on Cox model as an approximation

 \end{itemize}
\note{there are lots of issues, I moved them to extras
Might need to check PH assumption on LR test}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cox Model in the MI Setting}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Goal: To get a ``baseline'' Cox model, then add treatment variables
 \item Need to check for proportional hazards assumption
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Problem:  MI Cox model doesn't have residuals
  \item Solution: Check assumptions (Schoenfeld residuals) on stacked dataset or each MI dataset individually
 \end{itemize}
\item Cox model is normally distributed, use Rubin's Rules to pool
\item Add treatment covariates, rerun models, pool
\end{itemize}

 
\end{frame}
