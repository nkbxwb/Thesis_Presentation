\begin{frame}{Propensity Score in MI Setting}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Mitra and Reiter propose two methods \cite{Mitra2012}
 \item Within: Work with propensity score on each of the $m$ MI datasets
 \item Across: Average propensity scores across the $m$ datasets and then analyze with the averaged propensities
 \item Which to use: Dependent on your data
\end{itemize} 
\note{Another method: sample row from each of m datasets to get one sample}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Propensity Score: Questions To Ask}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generating the propensity score
\begin{itemize}
\item What to put into the model
 \item How to compute it: Logistic regression, Probit regression, CART, GBM, etc.
\end{itemize}
\item How to use the propensity score in the MI setting
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Matching, weighting, covariate adjustment, stratification
 \end{itemize}
\item What estimand do we care about?
\end{itemize} 
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Verifying Balance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Need the distribution of the groups to be similar
\begin{itemize}
\item Standardized bias: $|\bar{X}_{k1}-\bar{X}_{k0}|/ \hat{\sigma}_k$
\item Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 
\end{itemize}
\item Need to be sure that propensity scores are between 0 and 1
\end{itemize}
