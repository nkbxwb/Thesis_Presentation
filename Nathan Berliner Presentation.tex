\section{Introduction}

%\subsection{}

\begin{frame}{In an ideal world}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We would have a large dataset
  \begin{itemize}
   \item That was obtained from an RCT
   \item That would help answer a clearly defined question
   \item That had all the covariates of scientific interest
   \item That contained no missing data
  \end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{In Reality}

  \begin{itemize}
   \item RCT's are expensive and often unethical
   \begin{itemize}
    \item We often get retrospective observational data
    \item Pulled from a database or historical records
   \end{itemize}

   \item That would help answer a clearly defined question
   \begin{itemize}
    \item The data collected often doesn't support the question in mind
   \end{itemize}

   \item That had all the covariates of scientific interest
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Since often no control of experiment, no control over what is collected
   \end{itemize}

   \item That contained no missing data
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Since no control, we can't guarantee that everything is collected
   \end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Is This a Problem?}

  \begin{itemize}
   \item Without an RCT, we can't be sure if differences in treatments is due to the treatment or something else
   \item We often don't know what is of interest until we collect the data
   \item With missing data, we will be throwing away data and biasing our results
  \end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\subsection{The Problem}

% You can reveal the parts of a slide one at a time
% with the \pause command:
\begin{frame}{Second Slide Title}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    First item.
    \pause % The slide will pause after showing the first item
  }
  \item {   
    Second item.
  }
  % You can also specify when the content should appear
  % by using <n->:
  \item<3-> {
    Third item.
  }
  \item<4-> {
    Fourth item.
  }
  % or you can use the \uncover command to reveal general
  % content (not just \items):
  \item<5-> {
    Fifth item. \uncover<6->{Extra text in the fifth item.}
  }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Second Main Section}

\subsection{Another Subsection}

\begin{frame}{Blocks}
\begin{block}{Block Title}
You can also highlight sections of your presentation in a block, with it's own title
\end{block}
\begin{theorem}
There are separate environments for theorems, examples, definitions and proofs.
\end{theorem}
\begin{example}
Here is an example of an example block.
\end{example}
\end{frame}

% Placing a * after \section means it will not show in the
% outline or table of contents.
\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \alert{first main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    The \alert{second main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    Perhaps a \alert{third message}, but not more than that.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Outlook
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Something you haven't solved.
    \item
      Something else you haven't solved.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
