\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Recap}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Applied survival and causal analysis on MI cancer data
  \item Found overall,  any treatments better than none
  \item Other chemotherapeutics better than Capecitabine
  \item Lapatinib and Trastuzumab are about the same
 \end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Critiques}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item MI skeptics and method critiques
  \item Use of propensity scores
  \item Assumptions made throughout
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Future}
\begin{frame}{Further Research and Extensions}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Exploring the ``other chemotherapeutics''
 \item Competing risks
 \item AFT models
 \item Differing propensity score methods and instrumental variables
 \item Estimating counterfactuals as an MI problem in MI setting
 
\end{itemize}
