\begin{frame}{Kaplan-Meier in the MI Setting}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Clearly define the population, groups, and events of interest
  \item Ensure that we have noninformative censoring
  \item Issue: Kaplan-Meier is not normally distributed
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Solution: Complimentary log log transformation, pool \cite{Marshall2009}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Issue: Imputations leave one KM curve much shorter than the rest
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Solution 1: Truncate all curves at the lowest time
   \item Solution 2: Extend the curves out to the longest time
   \item Solution 3: Use the stacked method
  \end{itemize}
\item Algorithm: Pool the complimentary log log of the Kaplan-Meier curve, get estimates,
back transform
 \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Median Survival Time}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Want a measure of central tendency
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Survival distributions often skewed, so mean is poor choice
   \item Median (time the survival curve dips below 50\%) is a better option
  \end{itemize}
\item Algorithm: Take MI Kaplan-Meier curve, observe first 
 \end{itemize}
